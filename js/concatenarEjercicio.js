//Above we see the names of some VERY famous… italian renaissance artists, of course. Using the values stored in the variables we will be creating different ones that will hold the value of all or some of them. Let’s start by filling out the allTurtles variable.
//
//Use the += operator to concatenate the value of turtle1 into allTurtles.
//Use console.log() to see the new value of allTurtles the console output should be: ‘Leonardo’
